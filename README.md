- data-link="id" in each of navbar menu items which is correspond 'id' of sections in html
- Make function scrollIntoview()
### bug💥
- when evoke scrollIntoView event, navbar menu items(border) wasn't able to be active correctly.
- so I added function 'selectNavItem()' which is made from 'IntersectionObserver' into function scrollIntoview()
- finally when click navbarmenu,homecontact,arrow up button, navbar menu item was able to be active correctly. 

### Then what is the  function 'selectNavItem()'❓ you can see down below😆


### 2.Intersection Observer 🌈⭐️
### Function : when scrolling window, navbar memu items to be active by noticing some inersection change using 'Intersection observer API'
### For more great performence I made Intersection observer API
<br>

### Bad for performence example (without intersection observer) 💩
